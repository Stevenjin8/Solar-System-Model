                                    <p>For many of us the sun has a semi-constant presence, only disapating at night. Its presence depends on one's longitude. the closer one is to either pole, the more sunlight one will recieve during the summer and less during the winter. We see the Sun as the brightest and largest object in the sky and on average the earth is 150 million kilometers away from the sun. That distance is key to life on earth, if the Earth were any closer we would all burn, and if we were further we would all freeze.</p>

The closest it can be to Earth would be 628 million kilometers and the furthest it can be would be 928 million kilometers.

Halley's Comet was identified by astronomer Edmond Halley; after examining 3 seperate comet reports, he concluded that they were the same one. The last sighting of Halleys' comet was in 1986 and the next one will be in 2061.</p>
